# Submitting Issues

All feature requests and issues should be initially reported in the issues section for this repository on GitHub. We follow the convention of naming an issue by prefixing its description with the issue type, as in "Feature Request: xxx", "Bug: xxx", or "UI: xxx".

Try to use distinct and descriptive subject lines to make issues easier to identify. The description should include as much information as necessary to define the issue.
